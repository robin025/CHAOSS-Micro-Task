# CHAOSS Micro-task

This repository contains code for the CHAOSS microtask for the GSOC idea Create prototype metric view options on the CHAOSS website.

## Micro-task 1
- Familiar yourself with the website and GitHub repository. Make a pull request (PR) to the website repository - https://github.com/chaoss/website. If you have specific questions about a change you are proposing open an issue.
- This PR can be any change that makes an improvement to the CHAOSS website - https://chaoss.community/. For example, fixing typos, adding new content, or making certain that content displayed on the website is mapped directly to a markdown file in the repository.


PR's : 
- [Edited Mentee's link in mentorship page table #596](https://github.com/chaoss/website/pull/596)
- [verted speakers changed Typo/fixes #590](https://github.com/chaoss/website/pull/590#event-4527005018)


## Micro-Task 2
- Create one or more HTML navigation examples. This will require using HTML and CSS to demonstrate how navigation elements can be used to hide and show particular elements on a webpage. This task needs to be original code written by you, not code that has been copied from other sources. Upload the source code of your examples to a GitHub repository.

- Go to metrics sections in the demo website
- Only this repository contains the source code for the Navigation prototype and is designed with the Jekyll theme only to use Chaoss' website data, which is written in markdown, but the rest of the design and logic is written entirely in HTML, CSS, and javascript.
- I've added links to the main files where you can get the HTML, CSS, and JS to make it easier for you to find anything.
